# Simple Quiz Program Using C

## Description

This project is a simple multiple-choice quiz game written in C. The quiz reads questions from an external text file and presents them to the user in random order. Users input their answers and receive a final score at the end. Correct answers are rewarded, and incorrect ones incur a small penalty.

## Key Features
- **Random Question Selection:** Each time you run the quiz, questions are presented in a random order to keep the quiz fresh and engaging.
- **Score Calculation:** The program implements a scoring system where correct answers earn 1 point, and incorrect answers result in a deduction of 0.25 points.
- **Text-Based Input/Output:** The questions and possible answers are stored in an external text file (`PROJECT_QUIZ.txt`), making it easy to modify or extend the question set.
- **User Input Validation:** The program checks whether the user input is a valid choice (1/2/3/4) and processes the answer accordingly.
- **Penalty for Incorrect Answers:** To add a challenge, incorrect answers deduct points, simulating negative marking like in many competitive exams.
  
## Applications

This quiz program can be applied in various scenarios:

- **Educational Tool:** It can be used to create quizzes on different subjects, making learning fun and interactive for students.
- **Interview Practice:** The quiz can be used for practicing technical, aptitude, or general knowledge questions, preparing users for competitive exams or interviews.
- **Classroom Usage:** Teachers can use this program to create simple quizzes and evaluate students' performance on various topics.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/simple-quiz-program.git
    ```
2. Compile the program:

## Project Structure
- `Quiz.c`: The main C file that contains the quiz program logic.
- `PROJECT_QUIZ.txt`: A text file where quiz questions are stored. You can modify this file to add more questions or change the existing ones.

## Future Improvements
- Add more questions and categorize them by difficulty or topic.
- Implement support for multiple players, enabling score tracking for each player.
- Expand the scoring system with hints, bonus rounds, or time limits for answering.
- Implement a graphical interface for a more interactive experience.
